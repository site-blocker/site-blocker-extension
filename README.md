What if you could harness the power of the Donald Trump personality to focus on work? Well, now you can!

Our pundits screamed at each other until they created a website-blocking pomodoro timer powered by the Commander in Chief himself. 

With POTUS at your side, you can customize which sites you'd like to block while you're working. The blocked URLs unlock automatically during break times.

Should you try to take a break early, Trumpodoro will not only tell you, he'll ask donations for his campaign. Trumpodoro works on his agenda when you're not working on yours. 

Features include audio notifications, customizable list of sites to block, and pomodoro timer.

Welcome to Trumpodoro. 

Make Your Productivity Great Again.
